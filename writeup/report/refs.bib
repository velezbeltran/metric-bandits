abstract = {We propose an algorithm called query by commitee, in which a committee of students is trained on the same data set. The next query is chosen according to the principle of maximal disagreement. The algorithm is studied for two toy models: the high-low game and perceptron learning of another perceptron. As the number of queries goes to infinity, the committee algorithm yields asymptotically finite information gain. This leads to generalization error that decreases exponentially with the number of examples. This in marked contrast to learning from randomly chosen inputs, for which the information gain approaches zero and the generalization error decreases with a relatively slow inverse power law. We suggest that asymptotically finite information gain may be an important characteristic of good query algorithms.},

abstract = {We describe and analyze an online algorithm for supervised learning of pseudo-metrics. The algorithm receives pairs of instances and predicts their similarity according to a pseudo-metric. The pseudo-metrics we use are quadratic forms parameterized by positive semi-definite matrices. The core of the algorithm is an update rule that is based on successive projections onto the positive semi-definite cone and onto half-space constraints imposed by the examples. We describe an efficient procedure for performing these projections, derive a worst case mistake bound on the similarity predictions, and discuss a dual version of the algorithm in which it is simple to incorporate kernel operators. The online algorithm also serves as a building block for deriving a large-margin batch algorithm. We demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach by conducting experiments on MNIST dataset and on document filtering.},

For $T$ rounds, $K$ actions, and d dimensional feature vectors, we prove an $O\left(\sqrt{Td\ln^3(KT\ln(T)/\delta)}\right)$ regret bound that holds with probability $1-\delta$ for the simplest known (both conceptually and computationally) efficient upper confidence bound algorithm for this problem.  We also prove a lower bound  of $\Omega(\sqrt{Td})$ for this setting, matching the upper bound up to logarithmic factors.}
