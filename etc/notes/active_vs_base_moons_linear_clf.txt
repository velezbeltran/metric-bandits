To produce that plot the parameters used where

# Constants for the neural network
input_dim = 2
depth = 3
hidden_dim = 25
out_dim = 2
dropout = 0.3
normalize = False


# Constants for the environment
T = 1000
batch_size = 5
persistence = 2
eval_freq = 10
to_eval = ["linear", "embedding"]

# Constants for UCB
step_size = 0.001
num_steps = 1
train_freq = 10
active = True

The average was taken over 4 runs.
